This is a crude set of notes on the use of the group module.

The simple example only currently displays items from the bit_content table and
works with the content_id key to find those records. One or more secondary tables can be
added to the bit_content record. And these will be detailed in /admin/schema_inc.php

Unable to add group data via /admin/schema_inc.php at present as the content_id field
needs to be populated from it's generator, and this is not avialable when installing.

Currently group_id, title and data entries are displayed in the grid.

To Do Notes:-

Simple Edit for the same fields above so we can actually add groups.
Admin screen allowing switching of fields on and off?
